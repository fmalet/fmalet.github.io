My name is Fran√ßois MALET.

Statistician using (and also working for) SAS during a long time, I've (re)discovered the R tools 2 years ago. I decided to create this site for 3 reasons :

- continue to improve my R skills by writing post
- put at one place all the R tips and links I found interesting
- try to help people (you?) to learn R in a funny way




What else do you need to know ?

### my passion

- Learn new things.
- Discover new people.
- Travel.
- Practice sports and specially bodyboard at [Gohaud](http://a52.idata.over-blog.com/2/27/69/60/Bretagne/bretagne-2/002.JPG "Gohaud") or [Saint Gilles-Croix de Vie](https://sportyrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/saint-gilles-croix-de-vie-surf.jpg "Saint Gilles-Croix de Vie"), my 2 favourite places.
